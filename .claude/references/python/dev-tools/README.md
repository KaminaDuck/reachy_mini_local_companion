# Development Tools Reference Index

Reference documentation for development tools and utilities used in software engineering workflows.

## Tool Collections

### [Astral Python Tools](astral/)
Comprehensive documentation for Astral's suite of extremely fast Python development tools written in Rust:
- **uv**: Python package and project manager (replaces pip, poetry, pyenv, etc.)
- **Ruff**: Python linter and formatter (replaces Flake8, Black, isort, etc.)

### [mypy](mypy/)
Static type checker for Python that catches bugs before runtime using type hints and gradual typing.

### [pytest](pytest/)
Mature testing framework that makes it easy to write small, readable tests and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.
